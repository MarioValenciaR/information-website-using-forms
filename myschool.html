        <h2>Our history</h2>
        <p>The University of Ottawa (UOttawa), located in the heart of Ottawa, Ontario, the capital of Canada, was established in 1848, making it one of the oldest universities in the country. Initially founded as a Catholic institution, it has since evolved into a secular, publicly funded research university. UOttawa is recognized as the largest bilingual (English-French) university in the world, offering students the option to study in English, French, or a combination of both languages.</p>
